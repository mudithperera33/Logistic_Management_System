# 1\. About the Project

# 

* # This is a simple logistics management system made using C language.
* # The program helps user to manage cities, distances, vehicles, deliveries and reports.
* # It is a console-based program with menus.
* # I made it in Code::Blocks to practice arrays, functions and file handling.

# 

# 2\. Features

# 

* # Add, list, remove and rename cities
* # Add and view distances between cities
* # View details of vehicles (Van, Truck, Lorry)
* # Add and view deliveries with package weight and vehicle type
* # Generate simple reports like total cost and average cost of deliveries
* # Saves data to text files so program can load it next time

# 

# 3\. How To Run

# 

* # Open Code::Blocks and load the project or main.c file
* # Build and run the program using Code::Blocks (press F9)
* # Follow the menu to use city, distance, vehicle, delivery or reports options

# 



# 4\. How It Works

# 

# When program starts, it loads cities and distances from cities.txt and distance.txt.

# 

# Main menu appears with options for City, Distance, Vehicle, Delivery, Reports and Exit.

# 

# Each menu option calls a function for that task.

# 

# Example:

# 

# Add city → addCity()

# 

# Edit distance → editDistance()

# 

# Add delivery → addDelivery() calculates cost, fuel and time using formula:

# 

# cost = rate \* distance

# time = distance / speed

# fuel = distance / efficiency

# 

# 

# When program exits, it saves data automatically to files.



# 

# 5. Conclusion

# 

# This project helped me learn functions, arrays and file handling.

# Also learned how to break big problem into smaller functions.

# There are some small bugs and limitations but overall program works and does what it should.ogistics Management System
